# Smart Roads

A fuclty project in which we use our knowledge in software engineering, AI & ML, and hardware to build a smart road. 

**Feature of the project:**

1. The smart road will have multiple units.
2. Unit will be uniformally apart from each other (equal distances between them).
3. Each unit will consist of a camera and other sensors.
4. The light of the lamppost will be automatically turned on and off depending on the traffic.
5. The camera will be used to detect emergency cases and send images to the backend server.
6. The unit will count the number of cars past infront of it and this data will be used to help advertisers distribute their ads.
